# ElasticStackSetup

These scripts should be useful in setting up and configuring a locally-run Elastic Stack on a Linux machine

For an automated setup, make sure your working directory is `ElasticStackSetup/`, and run `setup_complete` as root

### How to install & run on your Ubuntu VM

```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo git clone https://github.com/nathancroce/ElasticStackSetup
cd ElasticStackSetup
sudo bash setup_complete
```
